		Gameplay:
		<br>
		Possibly multiple classes, each with special abilities
		<br>
		Some shared abilities
		<br>

		Lootboxes:
		<br>
		Items
		<br>
		Gear
		<br>
		Rewards for trying
		<br>
		New words to learn? (user gets currency for accepting the word in their list)
		<br>

		Items:
		<br>
		Potions
		<br>
		Combat modifiers (temp attk, def, ,ability cd reduction)
		<br>

		Microtransactions:
		<br>
		Language/topic packs (base game only allows you to manually input words and definitions)
		<br>
		Beginner/Intermediate/Expert versions (export your character through each, possibly buy premade characters for harder content)
		<br>
		Challenge packs. Can purchase a challenge pack. This allows you to create a set of questions that you can send to someone by giving them a code. (eg. a teacher can buy a challenge pack and give the the code to all the students in the class)
		<br>

		Balance:
		<br>
		Each level has a max potential stat (player cannot grind easier levels forever)
		<br>

		Combat Concept 1
		<br>
		Player and enemy autoattack each other
		<br>
		Damage is weapon damage at weapon speed + buffs
		<br>
		Answering correctly grants points which builds up a power meter
		<br>
		Answering incorrectly gives you 2 random questions you’ve already answered, before returning to the same question (order of answers is randomized)
		<br>
		Power meter:
		<br>
		Charges slowly on its own for both the player and enemies to 100%
		<br>
		Answering correctly adds a 20%~ charge to the meter
		<br>
		Answering incorrectly adds 50% to the enemy’s meter
		<br>
		Power meter is spent on abilities (gained through another system) with varying effects
		<br>
		Enemies will spend 25%, 50%, or 100% (depending on the enemy) of their power meter on a powerful attack (similar to Pokemon GO)
		<br>
		<br>
		Combat Concept 2
		<br>
		Action timer bar 
		<br>
		Starting charge time is 8 seconds for the player
		<br>
		You ready an action while the bar is charging
		<br>
		Default action is a basic attack
		<br>
		Answering correctly allows you to do a combo attack a reduces the bar’s charge time by 0.5 seconds (minimum 4 seconds)
		<br>
		Answering incorrectly gives you 2 random questions you’ve already answered, before returning to the same question (order of answers is randomized) and resets charge time to 8 seconds.
		<br>
		Not answering in time resets charge time to 8 seconds, does not change the question, and reduces combo by 1.
		<br>
		Abilities
		<br>
		Building up combo attacks allows you to use special abilities when certain numbers are met.
		<br>
		Enemies use abilities on a timer (some abilities start on cooldown, etc)
		<br>
		Enemy
		<br>
		Attacks during timer bar at certain points indicated (
		<br>
		Ultimate abilities:
		<br>
		Upon reaching a certain combo, or maybe a certain health threshold, characters use their ultimate ability as a quick time event.
		<br>
		Warrior: Fast slashes, fruit ninja style
		<br>
		Mage: Spawns fireballs that you have to launch at the enemy accurately.
		<br>
		Rogue: Accurately hit enemy weak points from multiple directions. 
		<br>

		Overworld Concept 1
		<br>
		Node-based dungeon (semi-randomly generated, explorable)
		<br>

		Each node may have certain events, usually a monster fight or a trap or some other challenge
		<br>
		Non-monster encounters will have questions in a different format.
		<br>
		There are multiple dungeons, each with their own loot tables and monsters
		<br>
		Dungeons have tiers which unlock with level (or some other less restrictive way)
		<br>
		Higher tiers have harder enemies and better rewards
		<br>
		Can be called something like “trials” so they don’t need to be restricted to underground caves, etc
		<br>

		Other Overworld Ideas
		<br>
		Final fantasy style, implement joystick touch controller for player to move around with, can have random encounters, manually travel to locations. 
		<br>

		Theme Concept 1
		<br>
		The world has fallen into oblivion. The curse of forgetfulness plagues most living things. What starts as a blank thought or deja vu slowly turns into madness. 
		<br>
		The few beacons of civilization remaining have found some way to stop the illness from getting worse.
		<br>
		You set out to venture through the towns and wilderness of the forgotten world to find the truth and hopefully a cure for this plague, using your own knowledge and memory as a weapon against the forgotten.
		<br>
		Lore details can be added.
		<br>
		You begin in a port town, one of many brave adventurers who have been called upon to retrieve supplies from the outside world which has been restricted for years (reasoning pending).
		<br>
		As you clear areas and locations (node-based dungeons), more will open up for you around the map.
		<br>

		Theme Concept 2
		<br>
		Should be dark, aimed at adults
		<br>
		Enemies are based on vegetables
		<br>
		The world has been overrun by vegetables. Previously the world was populated by humans which eventually went extinct due to (some reason). Fruits however survived and eventually evolved to be sentient and becoming human like in nature (product of biological engineering from humans (GMO?)). The cycle continued for the sentient fruit beings where a plague caused most to die out only leaving behind a few. What is left of the living species in the world is vegetables who are less evolved but are slowly evolving. Some new vegetable/fruit hybrids have also been seen around.
		<br>
		The vegetable culture is very tribal-esque, often following a distinct leader. The leaders (game bosses) are in fact fruits who believe they are vegetables (pumpkin, cucumber, green/red/yellow pepper). The vegetable imposters fail to realize how much more evolved they are compared to their vegetable brethren. Vegetables appear more monster like while fruits seem civilized and intelligent.
		<br>
		Each area visited would have a fruit orchard that is long dead and dry. Your mission would be to find the precious resource that is water and the seeds necessary to re-establish the fruit population(you are part of a rebellion). In this case the orchard would have around 8 trees (per area) that the player can choose to plant using the water and seeds obtained from looting. If a tree is successfully grown the player gets permanent upgrade bonuses which would encourage min/maxing. Maybe water can be tied to microtransactions or sparsely given by daily logins to encourage the player to come back and learn each day. Having water seem like a very precious resource would be very fitting in this post-apocalyptic setting.
		<br>
		Intro Gameplay
		<br>
		Brief lore intro cutscene goes over a few maps and creatures (skippable)
		<br>
		Start out in town: Darkest Dungeon/HoMM style with various clickable buildings in the background (most not built yet). [Side note: maybe game has several “acts” which are different towns you travel to and help develop/rebuild.] 
		<br>
		Tutorial tells you to buy your first weapon, get a choice of a sword, daggers, or bow. Then tells you to exit the town.
		<br>
		Overworld screen is similar, with a scrollable map full of interactable areas and dungeons (most unlock later).
		<br>
		First area to click on is a node-based forest. Exploration method tbd.
		<br>
		Encounter 1 & 2: Mad Boar. Gives XP and food resource (?)
		<br>
		Encounter 3: Crazed Woodsman. Gives XP and drops an axe weapon.
		<br>
		Yellow block gives a chunk of wood resource. Blue block captures a lumber mill, allowing workers from the town to work there and steadily supply the town with wood (set amount each time you finish a dungeon, possibly based on number of nodes travelled)
		<br>
		Return to town and build a structure with the wood gained. Ultimate goal for each town is to build a Memory Beacon (?) which grants abilities. Building this has different steps for each town.
		<br>
		<br>
		Base Stats
		<br>
		Life: Amount of damage you can take before you die.
		<br>
		Vitality: Scales your base Life by a percentage
		<br>


		Weapons
		<br>
		Weapons interact with charge timer and combo (combo doesn’t reset, timer is lower, etc)
		<br>
		You don’t necessarily find better gear, but upgrade your existing weapon type with enchantments and upgrades.
		<br>
		Either use the new gear you find, or disenchant it to upgrade your current weapon
		<br>

		Inventory Concept 1: Glyphs
		<br>

		3 different levels of items with varying ranges of strengths
		<br>
		Major, normal, minor
		<br>
		Set number allowed per level
		<br>

		Inventory Concept 2: Charms
		<br>


		Tetris-like Diablo Inventory
		<br>
		Size of item determines the type of effect (not just the strength)
		<br>
		Gives player more freedom
		<br>

		ITEM CONCEPT 2.0
		<br>
		Instead of weapons, items are essentially trinkets of power that bestow benefits upon the user possessing them.
		<br>
		Nature-based, randomly generated names: “Bountiful Nutrient of Malice”, “Solar Seed of Precision”
		<br>
		Higher class trinkets include some lower class trinket effects.
		<br>
		Possibly have actual prefixes and suffixes
		<br>
		For more complexity, can add damage types (Slash/Pierce/Impact). Would have to allow swapping active and inactive items though, which may be unnecessary.

		<br>
		Itemization is interesting in games where there are different ways to play.
		<br>
		Correct ways to play:
		<br>
		Answering questions correctly as fast as possible
		<br>

		Option 1
		<br>
		Answering a question correctly gives you a few seconds (3?) of freedom to attack in certain ways.
		<br>
		Allows for different weapon types and items that interact with them.
		<br>
		Players are incentivized to look for items that buff certain weapon types and playstyles.
		<br>
		Can incorporate QTEs with weak points/aim
		<br>
		Can incorporate AR?? (in which case, make it first person, fighting the monster, can have different weapons.
